# Restricted Boltzmann machines for RNA design

Based on https://github.com/jertubiana/PGM.

This repository contains an example Python code to train and sample a Restricted Boltzmann machine on SAM-I riboswitch aptamer domain family of homologous sequences (RF00162 on Rfam).

This is provided as an alterative in Python to the original repository https://github.com/cossio/SamApp2024.jl, which is in Julia.
